# Data Science Project

**Mini project for Data Science courses**

## Project Source Code  

For examination purposes, you can check the source code of the project. The repository is organized as follows:  

### 1. **model**  
- This folder contains all the code required to train our model, which is used for predicting the price of clothes.  
- Additionally, it includes the pre-trained model path, allowing the model to be run without retraining.  

### 2. **UI**  
- *[Details to be added]*

- This folder stores the raw data for each category collected during the crawling process.  

### 5. **crawl**  
- *[Details to be added]*  

### 6. **data**  
- *[Details to be added]*  

### 7. **EDA notebook**  
- This notebook contains the code for visualizing and analyzing the data during the exploratory data analysis phase.  

### 8. **preprocess_initial_data notebook**  
- This notebook focuses on normalizing the raw data and preprocessing it for training and visualization.  

### 9. **final_data.json and preprocess_data.json**  
- These files represent the processed data:
  - `final_data.json`: Data after preprocessing.
  - `preprocess_data.json`: Data prepared for model training.
